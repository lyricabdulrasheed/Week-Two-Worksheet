Biomass Gasification Data Analysis

This analysis focused on understanding the key characteristics and relationships within a biomass gasification dataset. By employing Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, the following key aspects were explored:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Data Loading: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Data Inspection: Initial exploration involved examining the data types, missing values, and statistical summaries.
Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled appropriately, and redundant or irrelevant columns were removed.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Categorical Data Analysis: The different types of biomass feedstocks were identified and their frequencies analyzed.
Numerical Data Analysis: Statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for numerical variables such as temperature, gas concentrations, and yield.
Correlation Analysis: The relationships between different variables were explored using correlation coefficients and scatter plots.
Data Visualization: Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of variables, identify trends, and uncover potential patterns. These included histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
